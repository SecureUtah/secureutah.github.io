# SecureUtah.org

## HTTPS should be the default and only method for all web traffic.


**SecureUtah.org** is the public face for several security-focused campaigns in Utah, beginning with advocacy for state-wide HTTPS adoption. Future efforts will concentrate on promoting digital security basics, improving data privacy, and using secure communication tools.  The emphasis will always be on providing a safer experience for the individuals and families that use the Internet as part of their daily lives.

Regrettably, not enough websites in Utah have made HTTPS their default. [**UtahWatch**](http://utahwatch.secureutah.org) was created to evaluate and compare the HTTPS usage of a selected group of Utah websites.

The content is hosted on GitHub Pages for now.  Eventually it will move to its own webserver.



This website is a labor of love and a work in progress.  Feel free to share your thoughts, ideas, criticism and suggestions:
